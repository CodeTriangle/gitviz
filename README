Visualize what's going on with your git repo.

Seemed like it would be helpful if you're giving a presentation on git or
something.

Run the following to set everything up:

    $ ./setup.sh

Then use the following to start monitoring:

    $ ./watcher.py

Send a SIGINT to watcher.py to trigger a manual redraw. Send another SIGINT
within 0.2 seconds of the first to exit the program completely.

appreciate if you linked to this repo or something if you use this in a
presentation.
